<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

From time to time, {{wsp_company}} may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>{{wsp_company}} also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on {{wsp_domainname}} blogs/sites. {{wsp_company}} only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>
